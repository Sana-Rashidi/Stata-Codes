Code Execution Instructions

To execute the code, please follow the instructions below:

1. Extract the assignment folder to a local directory on your machine.

2. Open the 0_master do file.

3. In the specified section of the master file, enter the local address where you extracted the assignment folder. No other changes are required in the code.

4. Ensure that the "Data" folder is present in the same directory as the master file. The "Data" folder should contain two files: sample_75_02.dta and work_history.dta

5. Optional: If you have the rdrobust, rdmse and cleanplots packages installed, you can comment out the package section related to them. This will improve the code execution speed.

6. Run the master file to execute the code.
 
7. For exporting Tables in the test parts, a connection to the internet is needed.

Please note that the code is designed to work as-is with the provided data files and folder structure. Modifying the code or the data files may lead to unexpected results.
